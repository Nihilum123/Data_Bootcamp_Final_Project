Project Description 

As Bitcoin's rapid increase in price has stirred debate about what it's value is, one question being considered is how to think of this new asset in relation to conventional securities and the market in general. Globally, regulatory bodies have differing stances on whether it is a security, a currency, a commodity, or something else. Some proponents for Bitcoin's value argue that it is a safe-haven asset because it is not affected by market performance and because it is not linked to government policy. In fact, one split from the main Bitcoin blockchain actually named itself Bitocin Gold in a direct reference to gold, the most famous and long-lived safe asset. For instance, one investor believed that millenials would place more trust in Bitcoin than in gold, allowing Bitcoin to continually grow in its capacity to act as a store of value. A cursory look at Bitcoin's history reveals that when there is geopolitical turmoil (Grexit, Brexit, North Korean Crisis, Venezuelan Instability) there are individuals who believe that the rise in Bitcoin prices can be attributed to people exchanging fiat for Bitcoin.

On the flipside, others believe the notion that Bitcoin could act as a safe-haven asset is absurd. They point to the fact that it has no underlying value, questionable transaction speeds and fees, a short history, and incredible price volatility as factors preventing it from being a secure long-term store of value. Existing literature in the area has either taken a broad look at relationships across Bitcoin and other assets over time or failed to analyze what the statistics actually mean on a granular level. This project attempts to offer a more in-depth and cohesive analysis of whether Bitcoin is the new digital gold
